# Wang & Strong (1997) Adapted Template by TE

## Intrinsic DQ

### Accuracy (reliability analysis, annotation precision and type, linking between the instances from GEBRU, quality control, genres of music), 

### Objectivity (adherence to theory), 


### Believability (clarity of instructions and annotations, eg: ?, 5, >25), 

### Reputation (no of times cited at the time of the writing, not contributing to  score)


## Accessibility DQ

Accessibility (public availability, discoverability of resources required to reproduce; music availability), 
Access security (e.g., authorization; how dataset can be downloaded)
[Gebru has more detailed questions]
Cost effectiveness (from 1996 paper) [not perhaps relevant, cannot be reduced]

## Contextual DQ

Relevancy (width of the coverage: annotation, features, music, lyrics, demographics, etc., what was sampling strategy from GEBRU),
Timeliness (relates to time obtaining/processing data): how quickly can you access the data?  Cf “functional open data” i.e. can access without human intervention
Value-added (filling gaps/inference, Novelty), 
Completeness (all items/datapoints available), 
Amount of data (stimulus N, participant N if individual level data incl. Perfect instance = raw data for each excerpt, stimulus length)

## Representational DQ

Interpretability & ease of understanding (documentation, clear metadata & construct definitions, human readability vs machine-readability), 
Concise representation (merge/build procedure; preprocessing; outlier removal), 
Consistent representation (what emotion framework is represented and how)
Type of acquisition of data (crowd-sourced, experts, university students, etc.)
